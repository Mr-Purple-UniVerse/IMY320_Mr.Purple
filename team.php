        </div>

        <p>I am currently a final year student studying towards my computer science degree at the University of Pretoria. Although computer science is regarded as a challenging degree, I have shown great perseverance and determination during my study journey so far. I am a strong believer in ‚Äòyou get what you give,‚Äô which has been prevalent over the past couple of years. Our degree and courses are outlined in such a way to ensure we develop both technical and non-technical (soft) skills to be applied in our future workspaces.
I would describe myself as a sociable, dependable, and committed person with a strong sense of determination in achieving goals I set for myself, both personally and in the workplace. I enjoy working in teams and collaborating with others. I am a strong believer in ‚Äòteamwork makes the dream work.‚Äô
My time spent at university has taught me to work both effectively independent and in larger teams as part of our course modules. This has taught me to work well under the leadership of team members and project mentors, as well as taking lead as the project team leader.</p>
